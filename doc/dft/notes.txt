Type Hinting DataFrames with `TypeVarTuple`

How `TypeVarTuple` Enables Complete DataFrame Type Hinting

Python 3.11's `TypeVarTuple`: The Missing Piece for DataFrame Type Hinting

Type-Hinting Generic Arrays and Generic DataFrames


// Description: 300 words

Python type hints have made Python code more maintainable and statically verifiable. With support for generic containers (such as `list`, `dict`, or `TypedDict`), Python developers benefit from detailed, nested type hints that completely specify type expectations for complex data structures. The same cannot be said for DataFrames, a complex container that (at least as implemented in Pandas) has not been able too express its true type. This changes with the introduction in Python 3.11 of `TypeVarTuple`, a new generic specifier that enables variadic generics.
