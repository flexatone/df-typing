How `TypeVarTuple` Enables Complete and Expressive DataFrame Type Hinting

Type Hinting DataFrames with `TypeVarTuple`

Python 3.11's `TypeVarTuple`: The Missing Piece for DataFrame Type Hinting

Type-Hinting Generic Arrays and Generic Variadic DataFrames


// Description: 300 words

Python type hints have made Python code more maintainable and statically verifiable. With support for generically typed containers (i.e, defining a `list` of `str` as `list[str]`), Python developers further benefit from type hints that completely specify complex, nested data structures. DataFrames are also a complex, nested data structure: index labels, column lables, and columnar values all have distinct types. And yet, at least with Pandas, generic DataFrame specification is not supported.

Taking advantage of the new `TypeVarTuple` (introduced in Python 3.11), StaticFrame has implemented support for complete generic specification of DataFrames. A DataFrame with date index labels, string column labels, and columnar types of integers and Booleans can now be specified as `sf.Frame[sf.IndexDate, sf.Index[np.str_], np.int64, np.bool_]`. Not only is `TypeVarTuple` variadic (used here to define zero or more columnar types), but interprets star-expanded variable-sized homogenous tuple types (or `Unpack` wrapped tuple types) as variable-sized regions of uniform types. For example, a DataFrame with integer index labels, string column labels, and columnar types with a single leading string column followed by zero or more float columns can be specified as `sf.Frame[sf.Index[np.int64], sf.Index[np.str_], np.str_, *tuple[np.float64, ...]]`. `TypeVarTuple` thus permits defining explicit columnar types of fixed or variable size. A DataFrame with no assumptions of index labels, column labels, or columnar types can be specified as `sf.Frame[Any, Any, *tuple[Any, ...]]`.

This presentation will demonstrate how `TypeVarTuple` permits type-hinting columnar types in DataFrames as well as variable-depth hierarchical indices. Using the same type hints for run-time validation with the `CallGuard.check` decorator, as well as automatically deriving and testing type hints at run-time `TypeClinic`, will be demonstrated.
